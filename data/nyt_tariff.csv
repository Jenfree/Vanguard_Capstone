50,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/25/archives/introduction-of-the-british-budget.html,,"In the House of Commons, on the 10th instant, the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose to make his financial statement. The House having resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means, he said that the year 1860 had long been marked out as an importent epoch in British commerce. The long annuities, amounting to £2,146,000, fell in; the war duties on tea and sugar, unless renewed, relapsed. Finally, the commercial treaty with France compelled the Government to adopt a new and unusual course. In making the financial statement before taking votes in supply, the result of the past financial year, inasmuch as that year had not been completed, must be given partly in the form of estimate; but the House might rely on the figures. Exceptional cases had affected the estimates. There was the expedition to China, and the additional cost of our military preparations. There was the French Treaty to be provided against in addition. Coming to the actual state of affairs, he showed that the total result of the revenue of the last year showed an increase over the estimate. The revenue had been estimated at £69,460,000; it had produced £70,578,000. On the other hand, the expenditure, estimated at £68,953,000, had been £69,270,000. It thus appeared that, under existing arrangements, there was an excess of income over expenditure. The excess, though it was already absorbed by disturbing causes, showed the wisdom of the arrangements of Parliament. The expedition to China, and excess of navy and army expenditure, had cost an additional £900,000 for the army, and £270,000 for the navy. The commercial treaty would, he calculated, cause a deduction of £640,000. This would cause a total deduction of £1,810,000, and would place us rather on the wrong side of the balances. But to compensate for this, he had received, most unexpectedly, part of a debt from Spain, in the shape of bills, to the amount of £500,000, half of which would fall due in the present financial year. In this way the balance would be reestablished. The estimated expenditure for the coming year involved an increase in the army and navy of £3,618,000. The total expenditure is estimated at £70,100,000. The estimated income for the coming year would not, in the first instance, be satisfactory; but, at all events, it would compel their attention to those matters which most require examination. He should estimate the revenue as the law at present stood, taking the duties on tea and sugar at the minimum and reduced rates, the income tax as it would stand under existing arrangements -- upon these terms the estimate of revenue for the coming year would give a total of £60,700,000, showing a deficit of £9,400,000. He did not ask them to provide for the payment of Exchequer bonds soon becoming due. Without this they had the deficit of £9,400,000. If they had not the treaty to deal with, they would know precisely what they had to face. They might keep the duties of tea and sugar at the present rate, which would leave the deficit at £7,300,000. Even this would involve an income tax of 9d. in the pound. To fill up the deficit as it stood, this would require the neat and intelligible income tax of ls. in the pound. Now came the question, what had become of the estimates of 1853? He had a clear answer to give. The succession duty had failed from causes due to the actual law. The debt caused by the Russian war entailed a large charge on the consolidated fund and the army and navy expenses now entailed upon us. The deficit thus caused was, however, fully compensated by the financial measures they had since adopted. The real cause was the immense increase of expenditure. Had that expenditure remained as it was in 1852, they would now have had a surplus of two millions. That increase amounted to no less than £14,720,000, equivalent to an income tax of 13 1/2d. in the pound. It would not, however, be fair to consider the increase of expenditure without taking into account the increase of its means. This was especially shown by the results of the income tax He went through the results of several years, showing an increase in the wealth of the country of 12 per cent, in the twelve years between 1842 and 1853, and of 16 1/2 per cent, in the six years from 1863 to 1859. No schedule shows a larger increase than that of the agriculturist, whose income had exceeded nineteen percent. Meanwhile, the expenditure has interested in a still greater proportion. In the years from 1842 to 1852 it had increased 4 1/2 per cent and in the years 1862 to 1856 it increased to 26 1/2 per cent. The increase was still more evident in that expenditure which was under the control of Parliament, and which he might call the optional expenditure; in that the increase, during the last six years, was not less than 58 per cent. Recurring to the means of meeting the deficit, he owned, that no was not satisfied with our system of expenditure; still, all changes must, of necessity, be gradual. There were again, commercial reforms and improvements. There were those who considered, that these reforms ought to be kept for fair weather and a flourishing exct[???]quer. Against that doctrine be earnestly protested He declared, on the part of the Government, that they were ready and prepared to go forward in commercial improvement. It was only by means of these reforms that the country was enabled to bear high taxation I Could the country have borne the High income tax of the last eighteen months if it had not been for increased taxation He showed from figures that the relaxation and reform of the commercial system had given the country not only this disposition but the power to pay this, inasmuch as the revenues of the departments were increased as the duties were relaxed. It thus appeared that indirect taxation should be relaxed in favor of direct taxation, and it only remained to us to say upon what principle. The Government did not at present intend to deal with tea and sugar. These were merely revenue duties, and involved none of the complexities of differential duties. The tailoring classes were more benefited by an enlarged system of tree trade than by relaxing individual duties, as creating higher price for labor. It was upon this principle the Government intended to act. They proposed to retain the tea and sugar duties at the present late for a year. He then gave an outline of the French Commercial Treaty. France reduces, from July 1, 1860, duties on coal; from Oct. 1, on iron; from Dec 1, on tools; from June 1, 1861, on goods manufactured from flax, hemp and jute; from Oct. 1, 1861, France removes all prohibitions on all English manufactured goods, placing on them an ad vstorem duty not exceeding 30 per cent. This maximum is, after three years, to be reduced to 25 per cant. On the other hand, England, on her part, abolished immediately and without exception all duties on manufactured goods. We reduce the duty on brandy from 15s. a gallon to the colonial duty of 8s. 2d.; and the duty on wine from 5s.10d. to 3s.; to be further reduced from April, 1861, upon a scale depending upon the strength of the wine. As to the effect of these reductions, he estimated from wine relief to the consumers of £830,000, and a loss to the revenue £515,000; on brandy, a revenue to the consumers of £446,000, and a loss to the revenue of £225,010; and the loss to the revenue on manufactured goods at £432,000, He declared that the treaty showed no subserviency to France. They had given nothing to France which they had not given as a rich gift to themselves, and they had made no sacrifices except what they would have made in any case under an enlightened system of trade. The system had answered its purpose of political estrangement, but political estrangement, but the new system answers its purpose by political amity. The union which had been in former days between France and England -- a union of the Governments -- should now be the union of the nations, He defended commercial treaties, when not arounded upon principles of exclusion, and gloried in avowing that the treaty was a consummation of free trade. He, entered into an elaborate defence of the treaty, declaring that we shall do equal good to ourselves and to France by the introduction of a liberal system, and declaring that wine, which, like tea in the last century, was the rich man's luxury, would, like tea, be the poor man's comfort. He denied that any of the duties repeated were revenue duties. As a proof they were only opposed by interested parties. He entered at great length into the wine trade, to show how injuriously the present system operated and what good effect might be expected by the alteration we had now done with France, what we had been laboring to do for years past. He paid a warm tribute to Mr. COBDEN, who as the apostle of free trade, had twice in his life achieved so signal a triumph. He stated that the immediate repeal of duties on French articles was not dressed by the French Government. On the contrary, it was the device of our own. He then came to a supplemental reform in the customs, giving a relief to the consumers of a[???] a million, and a less to the revenue of £010,000. He proposed to abolish the duties on butter, cheese, oranges, and eggs, and to recu[???]e those on timber and currants and hops. In return he proposed to levy on all articles exported or imported a registration due of one penny per packet. It gave a great [???]tea of the transactions of the country, that they would produce £300,000 per annum. He further proposed to lay moderate charges upon certain warehousing proceedings performed in the customs' offices for the benefit of the importer. By this they expected; £120,000. He then proposed a duty of 6s. per cwt. on chicory, as a protection, the coffee revenue. This, with an improvement on the coffee revenue which it would cause would profuse £90,000, Again, he proposed a penny stamp in brokers' contracts; a 3d. stamp upon dock warants; licenses to eating houses to sell wine and beer; a reduction in game certificates, which would increase the sale, granting those certificates for a few months at a reduced cost; to remove the execution from stamps or on checks drawn to self. He likewise repeated some other small stamp exemptions. He thus obtained an increase of £510,000 in the Customs, and £3;6,000 in the Inland Revenue. In management they hope to save £50,000 in Customs and £36,000 in the Inland Revenue. The total would be £981,000; thus compensating the second part of these Customs reforms. Thus, on the whole, including the loss on the French treaty, the new arrangements involved a loss of about £1,000,000. He next came to a larger item. He proposed to repeal the paper duty. That duty has already been condemned by a direct vote of that House. The actual duty not only operated unjustly against publications for the masses, but prevented the manufacture of paper from an enormous quantity of fibrous substances. So many articles might be made out of paper that a vast impulse would be given to rural labor. The Inland Revenue itself admitted that the present Jaw was untenable, and fully agreed with the Abolitionists that it ought to be repealed. The next repeal was that of the improved stamp upon newspapers, which involved great trouble and inconvenience. For the convenience of the newspapers who paid a three halfpenny stamp he proposed to introduce a three halfpenny book postage. He next proposed to abolish the hop credits, while on the other hand, he reduced the duty, which, including the paper duty, was a remission of one million, and considering the increase of consumption, which he valued at £840.000, the total loss to the revenue would be £3,000,000. while the relief to the consumers would be £3,931,000. Making further allowance for the new charges, and the saving in management, the net loss to the revenue would be £28,000. Thus, in the present year only forty six articles remained on the tariff, and only forty-four would remain in 1861. The tariff would be relieved of all its remaining deformities. He had proposed to take up hop and malt credits, which would give $1,400,000 to the Treasury in the present year. The account then stood thus for the coming year; expenditure, £70,000,000; income, made actual law, £60,700,000. From this deduct loss by remission of duty, which would reduce it to £58,592,000. But he proposed to retain the present tea and sugar duties, which raised the income to £60,002,000. This leaves a deficit of nine millions and a half. Against this there was the £140,000 of the malt and hop credits. To provide for the remainder, he proposed an income tax of 10d. in the pound on incomes above £150, and of 7d. on incomes under that sum, which would produce £8,481,000, and thus completely fill up the deficiency. This tax, and the present duties on tea and sugar, to continue only for the year. He concluded by a warm eulogium on the blessings of improved laws and a well regulated finance. A formal vote for imposing a duty upon chicory was then proposed.","In the House of Commons, on the 10th instant, the Chancellor of the Exchequer rose to make his financial statement. The House having resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means, he said that the year 1860 had long been marked out as an importent epoch in British commerce.

Visions may have arisen in his mind of the horrid gibbeting of his powdered bones, -- wrought into various-moulded forms, -- on the head tray of some ragged Italian exile. The break-neck races in which rival coaches enter, over the frost-roughened pudding-stone pavement of Fulton-street, would save such imaginings from every imputation of undue nervousness of body or mind on the part of those who entertain them. The attempted transfer of the institution of horse-racing from the Bloomingdale road, where it belongs by prescription, to the blooming dales and hills of the Central Park, has recently been nipped in the bud by the legal pincers. This is very well if it shall be followed by the use of the legal forceps for the removal of the more deeply-rooted coach-racing nuisance. It certainly seems unjust, that while a man in his own vehicle, risking chiefly his own neck, is checked by the brakes of the law, the drivers of coaches, freighted with the public, should be allowed to dash on, at almost steam engine speed, through the City's busiest streets.","CITY STAGE DRIVING--In the gypsum regions of Maine, in towns distant from water privileges and where steam-power is too expensive to be used for pulverizing the mineral lumps, they are put into springless carts and driven at so rapid rates over the not miraculously even roads of the place, that in a very short time they are reduced to powder.

In connection with this proceeding, Mr. SUMMER spoke at some length, vindicating liberty of conscience, and justifying Mr. HYATT's course. The Majority and Minority Committees on the John Brown Insurrection made their report. A synopsis of each we publish elsewhere. The Tariff bill was then taken up, and was strongly opposed by Mr. HUNTER, who argued that no change in the present tariff was necessary, as it afforded sufficient revenue for the economical support of the Government, and the extinguishment of the public debt. Mr. SEWARD spoke at length on the subject, and strongly advocated the bill and its immediate consideration. To postpone it to the next session, he said, would be to postpone it indefinitely. The arguments for postponing it were so weak as to show a manifest disposition to avoid the whole subject. By a vote of 25 against 23, further consideration of the bill was postponed. The Army Appropriation bill was taken up, and some of the House amendments agreed to. The Overland Telegraph bill, already passed by the House, was concurred in by the Senate. In the House the proceedings were not of much importance.

If a new tariff, as is the present, in many cases, be prohibitory upon articles which have been largely imported and are in common use, nothing can exceed the injustice and hardship of such a measure. Stocks of goods on hand will be advanced to an amount equal the duty, while the Government will not be benefited a penny. Two or three years will in many cases be required before domestic establishments can be in position to supply the market.

Such, however, is not the case. When, in 1841, the newly inaugurated administration of Gen. HARRISON found itself so surrounded with financial difficulties, arising from the expiring tariff of 1832, as to require the aid of a special session, the proclamation appeared on the 17th of March, convoking the meeting for May 31. With the exception of Mississippi, all the States which had not yet chosen representatives, held special elections, so that when Congress assembled, the usual numbers, bating those from the State named, were in attendance. In those days there was no telegraph to expedite the Presidential summons; hence the prolonged interval between the call and the meeting. Now there would be no difficulty in completing the elections and organizing the House within a fortnight; and if, as events appear to intimate, a special meeting shall be required, it may be had in time for even the most sudden emergency.","In the course of some re marks in this paper, yesterday, in regard to an extra session of Congress, we embraced among the causes likely to embarrass the action of the body, the fact that the representa-...

From this correspondence it is abundantly clear that Mr. LINCOLN and his colleagues, in issuing the notifications of blockade of the 19th and 27th of April, and in furnishing instructions to the commanders of the blockading squadron, are under the impression that they have done all that is required by the law of nations, and that all violators of the blockade after this warning, must take the consequence of their own acts. The resources of the Federal Government would seem to be sufficient to institute an efficient blockade of most of the Southern ports, and we shall probably soon hear that the blockade is complete. By the last advices, we learn that, on the 14th of the present month, gunboats were stationed off the months of the James, Elizabeth, and York Rivers; off Fort Monroe; and at the opening of Chesapeake Bay; while it is stated that the ports of Florida have been under blockade since the 6th inst. The cruisers of the Federal Government have been at active as need be. Several seizures have been already made and reported. On the 14th, the Argo was captured in Chesapeake Bay, coming from Richmond with a cargo of tobacco, valued at $150,000. This prize fell to the lot of the gunboat Quaker City. The Crusader has seized the Wanderer off Key West, and the United States ship Yankee is reported as having been off Cape Hetlopen with no less than three steamers in charge. These prizes are all, it is believed, American vessels, and we do not find that there is any disposition to molest the neutral flag anywhere, or on any pretence. It is to be observed, moreover, that all the seizures so far have been made by the cruisers of the Federal Government. The authority conveyed in President DAVIS' proclamation, and confirmed by the Southern Congress to it out vessels under letters-of-marque and reprisal, does not seem, so far, at least, to have enabled those who have obtained such letters to protect the shipping of the South, much less to encounter anywhere the blockading squadron. This is the more strange, seeing that applications are said to have been made for letters-of-marque from the shipowners of New-England, the whalers of New-Bedford, and elsewhere in the Northern State -- persons, we should say, who would be able to fit out a most effective and formidable fleet of privateers.",We publish in another column the more important of the communications referred to by the Foreign Minister on Tuesday night as having been received from Lord LYONS and the Federal Government. ,"{'main': 'COMMENTS OF THE PRESS ON THE CORRESPONDENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COMMENTS OF THE PRESS ON THE CORRESPONDENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-13T05:00:00+0000,article
113,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/14/archives/montgomery-and-the-government-letter-from-mr-russell.html,,"In my last letter I gave an account of such matters as passed under my notice on my way to this city, which I reached, as you are aware, on the night of Saturday, May 4. I am on difficult ground, the land is on fire, the earth is shaking with the tramp of armed men, and the very air is hot with passion. Mty communications are cut off, or are at best accidental, and in order to reopen them I must get further away from them, paradoxical as the statement may appear to be. It is impossible to know what is going on at the North, and almost the same to learn what is doing in the South out of eyeshot; it is useless to inquire what news is sent to you to England. The telegraphic communications are now broken, so are all the mall routes. Newspapers and letters now and then reach well-known people here from New-York in six or seven days. Events hurry on with tremendous rapidity, and even the lightning lags behind them. The people of the South at last are aware that the ""Yankees"" are preparing to support the Government of the United States, and that the secession can only be maintained by victory in the field. There has been a change in their war policy. They now aver that 'they only want to be left alone,' and they declare they do not intend to take Washington, and that it was merely as a feint they spoke about it. The fact is, there are even in the compact and United South men of moderate and men of extreme views, and the general tone of the whole is regulated by the preponderance of the one or the other at the moment. I have no doubt on my mind that the Government here intended to attack and occupy Washington -- not the least that they had it much at heart to reduce Fort Pickets as soon as possible. Now some of their fritnos say that it will be a mere matter of convenience whether they attack Washington or not, and that as for Fort Pickens, they will certainly let it alone, at all events, for the present, inasmuch as the menacing attitude of Gen. BRAGG obliges the enemy to keep a squadron of their best ships there, and to retain a force of regulars they can ill spare in a position, where they must to in lose enormously from diseases incidental to the climate. They have discovered, too, that the position is of little value so long as the United States hold Tortugas and Key West. Out the Conferences are preparing for the conflict, and when they have organized their forces, they will make, I am satisfied, a very resolute advance all along the line. They are, at present, strong enough, they suppose, in their domestic resources, and in the difficulties presented to the advance of a hostile force by the nature of the country, to bill defiance to invasion, or, at all events, to inflict a very severe chastisement on the invaders, and their excited manner of speech so acts upon their minds that they begin to think that they can defy, not merely the United States, but the world. Thus it is that they declare they never can be conquered, that they will die to a man, woman and chilo first; and that if fifty thousand, or any number of thousands, of Black Republicans get one hundred miles into Virginia, not one of them shall ever get out alive. Behind all this talk, however, there is immense energy, great resolution, and fixed principles of action. Their strategy consists in keeping quiet till they have their troops well in hand, in such numbers and discipline as shall give them fair grounds for expecting success in any campaign with the United States troops. They are preparing with vigor to render the descent of the Mississippi imposible, by erecting batteries on the commanding levees or embankments which hem in its waters for upwards of eight hundred miles of bank, and they are occupying, as far as they can, all the strategical points of attack, or defence within their borders. When everything is ready, it is not improbable that Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS will take the command of the army, for he is reported to have a high ambition to acquire reputation as a General, and in virtue of his office he is Generalissimo of the armies of the Confederate States. It will be remarked that this plan tress upon the assumption that the United States cannot or will not wage an offensive war, or obtain any success in their attempts to recover the forts and other property of the Federal Government. They firmly believe the war will not last a year, and that 1862 will behold a victorious, compact slaveholding confederate Power of fifteen States, under a strong Government, prepared to hold its own against the world, or that portion of it which may attack it. I now but repeat the sentiments and expectations of those around me. They believe in the irresistible power of cotton in the natural alliance between manufacturing England and France and the cotton producing Slave States, in the force of their simple tariff, and in the interests which arise out of a system of free trade, which, however, by a rigorous legislation they will interdict to their neighbors in the Free States, and only open for the benefit of their foreign customers. Commercially, and politically, and militarily, they have made up their minds, and never was there such confidence exhibited by any people in the future as they have, or pretend to have, in their destiny. Listen to their programme.","In my last letter I gave an account of such matters as passed under my notice on my way to this city, which I reached, as you are aware, on the night of Saturday, May 4.

It is not pleasant to tell Mr. So-and-so, to his face, our opinion of him, especially so long as he is our equal in position and power. But when we believe him to have fallen, we are outspoken in proportion to our supposed immunity. In this way, the crisis in America has unmasked England as nothing else could. Her ruling classes believed that the final dissolution of the great Republic was accomplished. The eagerness with which this was proclaimed showed the wish to be father to the belief. Our institutions were denounced -- ""the best of them,"" says the London Times, ""having gone all wrong for a long time past:"" the character of our people was caricatured and vilified; and the contest in which we are engaged stigmatized as an unprincipled struggle for territorial aggrandizement. Not the slightest sympathy was expressed for us in our great strait, when it seemed for a moment that we might go down; nor for the cause for which we were fighting -- the rights of humanity and a Constitutional Government. England stood by, not an indifferent spectator, but eager to witness a final dissolution that would rid her of a hated commercial rival, and stamp as utterly impracticable those institutions which for a long time have threatened to subvert her own. Thank Heaven, our Government is not dead, or dissolved. What was to have been the fatal blow has only given to it new life and power. What was valuable in its institutions is to exert a tenfold greater influence than ever. A giant stands for the fallen victim, confronting his libeler face to face. Whatever may be the result, the entente cordiale is completely severed, not to be restored, till a new sentiment and a new Government in England shall supplant the old. The lowest of all qualities has that country displayed -- jealousy of a child, whom she would crush rather than suffer to exist as a rival. Henceforth the two countries will stand as antagonists in ideas and in aims. The peace between them will be that of an armed neutrality. Her historical relation toward us has been that of an arrogant superior. We have long tried to outgrow the sense of the insults and injuries we have received, and had hoped we had succeeded, but the last is the unkindest cut of all. It dispels our illusions of the possibility of a hearty friendship with her, and shows that we must look elsewhere for friends in fighting the battle of humanity.","One nation often serves as a mirror which reflects to another dispositions which, from prudential motives have long been suppressed or concealed.

All this, and more, the people will endure willingly, if our righteous war can be prosecuted with requisite vigor and success, and the gigantic rebellion can be crushed out.","{'main': 'A REVENUE PLACER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A REVENUE PLACER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-06-16T05:00:00+0000,article

To be sure, this is a concio ad populum, -- an address, not to patriotic capitalists, but to patriotic private citizens. But in America every man is a man of business, and even if he were not we should have thought that very few persons possessing $50 were of so low an intelligence as to be the victims of so gross a rhetorical artifice as that which is attempted to be practiced upon them. Mr. CHASE says all that can be said with truth, -- perhaps, all that can be said in favor of the loan. But we should have thought that there must be few persons, indeed, among the public that he addresses, who do not know that there is nothing so clear that something may not be said on the other side. Let us suppose, for instance, the appeal of the Secretary for the Treasury submitted to a knot of Southern politicians. Does Mr. CHASE suppose that they would have nothing to urge against it -- we do not mean on the questions of duty and patriotism, but on the smaller, though not unimportant question, of the reward proposed for the opportune exercise of these virtues? We could imagine persons, for instanse, perverse enough to urge that the interest of seven and three-tenths per cent. by no means covered the risk to be incurred: that the provision of a revenue by Congress for one year by no maeans guaranteed a provision of the same revenue for the next; and that the creation of a sinking fund by no means implied the appropriation of that fund to the reduction of the debt. We could imagine them venturing to question the confident anticipation that the war will terminate early next, Spring, and to anticipate new loans even if that should be the case, and much more, of course, if it should not. Some persons might be disposed to think that these new loans would require more patriotism in the lenders, and therefore secure a higher reward than the old ones, and that the value of the old ones would thus be inevitably depreciated. It might be suggested, also, that the same state of feeling in the West which has rendered it necessary to tax it on a different scale from the East may result in a refusal to pay sums borrowed in the cause in which the Western States believe themselves to have but a remote and secondary interest, and it may also be thought that we have not yet reached tire limit of secession, and that heavy pecuniary burdens may be found quite as strong a disintegrating force as the protective tariffs of the North or the domestic institution of the South. We will not advert to the possibility of another defeat, for that, of coarse, is a suggestion too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. We do not presume to say what force is to be given to these rival considerations, but we think that, if Mr. CHASE chose to address his countrymen at all, he ought not to have confined himself so exclusively so his own side of the question, but ought also to have given some proof that he was capable of embracing the opposite point of view. It the interest offered is sufficient, the appeal to patriotism and the argument as to the safety of the investment are unnecessary. If it is insufficient, the remedy would have been to increase the amount, instead of appealing to considerations which, rightly viewed, amount to little more than a confession of weakness. People will be more ready to believe that a sufficient provision will be made for the payment and interest of the war loans of the Federal Government, when they see that provision has been made for bearing one farthing of the expense out of the income of the year. When this is not done, it seems not unnatural to conclude that those who are anxious during the heat and excitement of the contest to throw the whole burden on posterity, will become impatient of that burden when the heat and the contest have passed away.","We must express some surprise at the very low estimate which Mr. CHASE appears to make of the [???] of his countrymen.

It was not, however, unnatural that the rebels and their allies should not assent to this view, but should place their action upon very different grounds. The difficulty has lain in their inability to agree among themselves as to the real reason of the matter any better than they could agree with us. Mr. STEPHENS said it was in order to establish freedom upon its true corner-stone of Slavery, and to get rid of that element of weakness which pervaded the ancient Constitution, in that it considered freedom as the true basis of freedom. Mr. YANCEY did not admit this. In his view, the South had rebelled on account of the tariffs which they had heretofore carried through the National Congress. Others said it was because of the Abolitionists. Others attributed it solely to the election of Mr. LINCOLN. All these conflicting views must, however, now be abandoned. JEFF. DAVIS must be considered as having a higher authority to speak upon this point than either YANCEY or STEPHENS, and in his Inaugural he has declared very explicitly what was the real cause of the rebellion. He tells us that it was because the rebels ""believed that to remain longer in the Union would subject them to a continuance of a disparaging discrimination."" We trust that hereafter we shall hear no further discussion on this point. Mr. DAVIS' authority is the highest, and no one could venture to say that the reason which he gives is an improbable or insufficient one. If the rebels have plunged headlong into perjury and treason, into theft and murder, and all the crimes of the calendar; if they have uprooted the peace of a Continent, and brought evils upon the land which will be felt for long years in the sorrows of hearts made desolate, and in heavy burdens to be borne by our children's children; if they have prostrated the prosperity of their own section of the country and quite possibly utterly overthrown the system which, as they claimed, was the foundation of that prosperity -- what are these evils, when weighed in the balance against ""a disparaging discrimination?"" Before this, all the crimes of the old tyrannies must ""pale their ineffectual fires."" Let us hear no more of them. We have learned of a yet deeper depth of atrocity than past history has told us of. Henceforth, if any one speaks of dragonnades, of conscriptions, of star-chambers and inquisitions, we shall say triumphantly, what do all these popular wrongs amount to compared with this continuance of a disparaging discrimination?",Editorial on Davis reasons for secession as stated in inaugural address,"{'main': 'The True Cause of Rebellion Disparaging Discriminations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The True Cause of Rebellion Disparaging Discriminations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article
138,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/03/02/archives/the-custom-house-business-of-the-past-week-activity-in-the.html,,"During the week just ending the business of some departments of the Custom House has been largely in excess of that usually transacted. Most of the business during that period has been transacted by the clerks of the Warehouse Department, the receipts from the duties on bonded goods approaching $200,000 some days of the week. This sum is much greater than that usually received from this source of revenue; indeed there have been but few days in many years when the sum paid equaled that named. The explanation of this sudden increase of duties received is probably as follows: During the past month or two large quantities of goods of certain descriptions have been placed in bond. The largest invoices thus warehoused have been of sugar, coffee and tea, the last two of which are articles which under the former tariff laws were scarcely ever bonded, inasmuch as they were allowed entry free of duty. The high rates of duty now levied on the three articles mentioned force the importers of them to take advantage of the warehousing privilege, and the result of their so doing has been the deposit of millions of pounds of them in public store since the beginning of the year. The passage of the Treasury Note Bill with the important amendment requiring duties to be paid in the demand notes of the first issue, or in coin, together with the probability of the passage of a new tariff act, which the importers, in their timidity, fear may take effect on the goods already imported and in bond, has caused the owners of such merchandise to withdraw it as quickly as possible. In thus doing, they have found it necessary to demand Treasury notes at the banks with which to pay their duties at the custom-house; here they met with a difficulty which they had not foreseen -- the banks having been so particular, of late, about receiving demand-notes in large sums, were destitute of the required quantity. A large proportion of the duties received have been from the articles already mentioned.","During the week just ending the business of some departments of the Custom House has been largely in excess of that usually transacted.

The people of Canada are pointedly told that it is of no sort of consequence to the English Government whether they remain a component part of the Kingdom or not. Now, Canada is one of the largest dependencies of the English Crown. It has cost the mother country many millions of pounds to hold and fortify it. It has cost many millions more to build railroads and canals, and immense bridges, to develop it. It has cost larger sums still to guard it against apprehensions of American cupidity, and to settle international quarrels growing out of the Northeastern boundary, the burning of the steamer Caroline, and the capture of the Confederate envoys by Capt. WILKES. Canada, from having been a poor and sparsely settled Province, has grown to be a respectable and comparatively prosperous country. It has never been of any pecuniary value to the British Government, but now is in a fair way to become so, if the population has intelligence and energy to make available the vast improvements that British wealth has introduced among them. It is just at this moment that English statesmen declare to the world that the retention of Canada is not an object of their desire, and that the people of Canada may assume their independence whenever they think proper to do so.","The recent debate in the English Parliament on Canadian affairs, an extended report of which may be found on another page, has no parallel in the history of the British Empire.

The value of the manufactured products which England sent abroad in 1861, was nearly eleven million sterling less than were exported in the preceding year. Of this serious decrease, more than nine-tenths was due to the falling off in the trade with the United States. For, in 1860, the total value of the British products entered at our ports, amounted to twenty-one and a half millions, while last year it declined to nine millions, showing a diminution of upwards of twelve million, or nearly sixty percent.","We have received our usual early copy of the Annual Report of the British Board of Trade, which will be found very suggestive at the present moment.

The many calls for money from New-York on county and town bounty bonds now being made, at 7 per cent. interest, for counties and towns in the vicinity of New-York, is supposed to be the cause of our loan failing to be taken yesterday.

Several domestic producers then sold out, and by 1970 only three remained - Carlisle, Uniroyal Inc. and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company - sharing 60 percent of the market.

Assuming that it were enacted by a two-thirds vote of the Senate and House and ratified by three-fourths of the states, the balanced budget amendment could not take effect until well after the 1984 election. Presumably, the effect it would have on the recovery would be psychological - an immediate lift in the spirits of consumers, savers, investors and businesses burdened by heavy debt and high interest rates.

Washington's handling of the pipeline, he said, has ''cast a shadow over relations'' between Europe and the United States, ''damaging confidence as regards future agreements.''   But it's not just the pipeline that has made a mockery of Versailles. Charges of unfair trade practices and threats of retaliation in a half-dozen industries are flying back and forth over the Atlantic -and the Pacific, too - in a worrisome crescendo.  Businessmen, dismayed by the long seige of sluggish economic growth that has left some 30 million people in the West unemployed, are doing what comes naturally: pressuring politicians to restrain imports, subsidize exports, or both.

Supply-side strategists and liberal spenders alike subscribe to the belief that increased capital formation is the essence of a sound economy, bolstering America's productivity and thereby reducing inflation and improving the nation's international competitiveness.

The officials confirmed a desire to accelerate the creation of a European-style single market to 2015 as the region struggles to strengthen its economic muscle.
